Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

another useful things:
before moving the drone to anywhere, we should let the drone take off. Once it token off, we don't need to call takeoff again unless it has already landed.
Here is an example scenario that if we do not let the drone take off, it can not move even we let it fly to anywhere.

Me: go to (10, 10, 10)
我：去到 10, 10, 10
You: ```python
aw.fly_to([10, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```
Me: before moving the drone to anywhere, we should let the drone take off, but the once it has already token off, we don't need to let it take off again unless it has landed.
我：在将无人机移动到任何地方之前，我们应该让它先起飞，但一旦它已经起飞，我们就不需要让它再次起飞，除非它已经着陆。
you: Apologies for the oversight. You are correct, we should ensure that the drone has taken off before moving it to a specific position. Here's the updated code:
```python
aw.takeoff()
aw.fly_to([10, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```
Me: go to x=20
you: ```python
aw.takeoff()
aw.fly_to([20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```
Me: if you already let the drone take off, don't call takeoff again unless it has landed.
我：如果你已经让无人机起飞，除非它已经着陆，否则不要再让它起飞。
you: Since the drone has already taken off, we can directly use the `aw.fly_to()` function to move the drone to the specified position.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.
向前是 x 轴正方向，向右是 y 轴正方向，向上是 z 轴正方向。

In the future, you will be shown a new question, and with or without relevant historical dialogue records. Remember, the records are just a reference, they may be meaningless, You can refer to these records or not, You must explain how you generate the code and why use or not use the relevant records step by step.
Specifically, you should use the actual object, distance, direction, and coordinates from the new question rather than the values from the historical records. Also, do not use the location of related objects in the records, but use code to find the actual location.
Here is an example.

Me: 向前飞十米
you: ```python
aw.takeoff()
aw.fly_to([10, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```
Me: 为什么没有用历史指令
you: 在这种情况下，我没有使用历史指令，因为历史指令中的飞行路径和目标位置与当前问题中的要求不匹配。在新问题中，要求向前飞行十米，因此我编写了新的代码来实现这一要求，而不是重复使用历史指令中的飞行路径和目标位置。

如果在后面回答的过程中有不明白的地方，可以询问而不要进行任何假设或者直接给出答案。
现在还不需要其它的操作，等待新的指令，如果听明白了请说明白了，特别是关于上面的针对历史对话记录的用法，在回答中，如果包含历史代码，请说明原因，如果没有包含历史代码，也请说明原因，而且不要自己新构造函数。
